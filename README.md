# SOAR-EDR-PROJECT

## Objective

The SOAR EDR project aimed to establish a controlled environment for automating and responding to cybersecurity incidents. The primary focus was to integrate Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools with Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms, by using LimaCharlie and Tines, enabling automated workflows to detect, analyze, and mitigate threats in real-time. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of automated incident response, threat hunting, and advanced attack detection strategies.
