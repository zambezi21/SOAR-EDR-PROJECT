# SOAR-EDR-PROJECT

## Objective

The SOAR EDR project aimed to establish a controlled environment for automating and responding to cybersecurity incidents. The primary focus was to integrate Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools with Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms, by using LimaCharlie and Tines, enabling automated workflows to detect, analyze, and mitigate threats in real-time. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of automated incident response, threat hunting, and advanced attack detection strategies.

## Steps
- The first step that was taken was to create a diagram of the project.

   *Ref 1: Network Diagram*

- The second step was to install and setup LimaCharlie. As well as confim events. Once there has been a LimaCharlie account created and installed on the Windows VM, on the host one will be able to click on the sensor of the VM and find infomation about the server. As well as find and view much more event info from the VM.

- The thrid step was to generate telemetry using Lazagne as well as create a detection and response rule.
